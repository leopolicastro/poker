### Backlog/Ideas

- [ ] Use ruby_llm gem for ai players
  - [] Get people to create their "virtual poker players" which are autonomous/agentic and will play for them??
    - Then we could have tourneys where no people are playing, but their avatar is playing for them, and then it becomes a spectator sport.
    - People would need the ability to customize their avatars strategy at any time, mid tourney even.
      - Some sort of setting, like aggressive, conservative, defensive etc
    - Leaderboards
    - Prizes (fake money probably)
    - Scheduled tourneys
    -
